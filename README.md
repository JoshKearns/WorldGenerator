# WorldGenerator

I am building a random world generator.

Currently I'm following Sebastian Lague's planet generator playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8) to generate terrain but am not entirely happy with the quality. It cannot generate enough faces to look seamless and lower face counts leave jagged edges. I will probably restart with a custom generator to go for a low poly aesthetic.

I'm looking to added everything randomly through code including trees/ bushes, rocks, ruins, animals, resources, etc. by spawning them above the surface and raycasting down to check for available/ suitable placements.

Idealy I want multiple planets you can travel to and explore like a discount No Mans Sky.
